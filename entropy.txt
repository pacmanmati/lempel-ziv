Entropy = 4.648634 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 75125 byte file by 41 percent.

Chi square distribution for 75125 samples is 1057257.86, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 89.1762 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 4.000000000 (error 27.32 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.136493 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
